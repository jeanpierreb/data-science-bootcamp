# Data Science Bootcamp
This is the curicullum I am following to begin learn artificial intelligence. I am starting with Data Science which as the name suggests is the science of gathering, organizing and gaining insights from data. The resources listed below are mostly free and cover the foundations of the subject. An experienced and highly motivated software engineer should be able to complete this in under 12 weeks, which is why I am calling it a "Bootcamp."

I'll expand this document as I go along with projects and a more thoughtful treatment of the courses especially after I've taken them.

### Kaggle
The courses Kaggle offers are designed to be easy and accessible without sacrificing depth. It is the best introduction to the various subjects as I've seen. I am able to do about 1 coures per day without putting in excessively long hours. Since they're free I'll go through all of them, but I'll probably start multi-tasking after "Computer Vision."

1. Intro to Programming
2. Python Course
3. Intro to Machine Learning
4. Intermediate Machine Learning
5. Data Visualization
6. Feature Engineering
7. Intro to SQL
8. Advanced SQL
9. Intro to Deep Learning
10. Computer Vision
11. Time Series
12. Data Cleaning
13. Intro to AI Ethics
14. Geospatial Analysis
15. Machine Learning Explainability
16. Intro to Game AI and Reinforcement Learning

### Fast.ai
Fast ai is incredibly well reviewed by people interested in Deep Learning. These are a hybrid between courses and books and should be fairly easy reads, especially after going through the Kaggle material.
1. [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)
2. [From Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/part2.html)
